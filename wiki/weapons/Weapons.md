## Flanker

### Primary Weapons

#### The Colbat
**Type:** Primary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** +40% faster firing speed, +40% more accurate, On kill: 33% refill for all meters
- **Negative Stats:** -33% clip size, -33% less ramp up, -20% damage penalty
- **Changes:** Reduced the on-kill refill from 50% to 33%
- **Reasoning:** Reducing the on-kill refill from 50% to 33% would make it so that it won't refill almost instantly within 2 kills. The Flanker would need to work his way up even more with 3 kills to refill it fully.

#### The Soda Popper
**Type:** Primary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** +50% faster firing speed, +25% faster reload speed, On Hit: Builds Hype
- **Negative Stats:** -66% clip size
- **Changes:** Added a 25% faster reload speed, Removed the no double jump penalty, Removed 50% faster reload speed when hype is active
- **Reasoning:** In my opinion, TF2's Soda Popper isn't that overpowered, so the reason why TC2 removed it's reload speed bonus and gave it a no double jump downside is questionable at best.

#### Specialist (V.1.)
**Type:** Primary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** +15% faster firing speed, +15% clip size, +20% more healing from packs and secondaries, +20% faster recharge time for secondary meters
- **Negative Stats:** -20% damage penalty, -15% max reserve ammo
- **Changes:** Added a '+20% more healing from healing sources' stat, Added a '+20% faster recharge time for secondary meters' stat, Removed the '+1 capture rate on wearer' stat, Increased damage penalty from 15% to 20%
- **Reasoning:** My goal on this small rework to this weapon is make the Flanker a 'Specialist', it's in the name. I always wondered what it would be like to play around with the name of this weapon by making Flanker an actual specialist, so I made it more supportive and passive with the healing.

#### Specialist (V.2.)
**Type:** Primary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** Clip size increased on kill, +25% faster reload speed
- **Negative Stats:** -33% clip size, -20% damage penalty
- **Changes:** Added a 'Clip size increased on kill' stat, Added a '+25% faster reloaded speed' stat, Removed '+1 capture rate on wearer' stat, Removed '+15% clip size bonus' stat, Added '-33% clip size' stat, Increased damage penalty from 15% to 20%
- **Reasoning:** Another idea I used to have for Specialist, Flanker's bulletstormer. This is mostly experimental.

#### Specialist (V.3.)
**Type:** Primary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** 50% of your clip reloaded and secondary meters cooldown reduced on kill, 20% more accurate
- **Negative Stats:** -33% clip size, -20% damage penalty, -20% slower reload speed
- **Changes:** []
- **Reasoning:** []

#### The Slugger
**Type:** Primary | **Status:** Concept
- **Positive Stats:** This weapon is always accurate, 10% less falloff
- **Negative Stats:** -90% pellets per shot, -20% slower firing speed
- **Changes:** Slug shotgun concept, Single bullet per shot, Baseball-themed naming
- **Reasoning:** An idea conceptualized by a friend, making a new Flanker primary weapon a slug shotgun. The name of the weapon is also a reference to Baseball, since Slugger's a term for the sport. It fits Flanker's personality name-wise.

### Secondary Weapons

#### Concealed Carry
**Type:** Secondary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** +20% faster firing speed, On Kill: Gain +63 health back, Health gained on kill can overheal
- **Negative Stats:** -30% damage penalty, No overheal from Doctors
- **Changes:** The overheal gain from a kill drains slower, similar to Conniver's Kunai, Removed the 'Overheal does not decay' stat
- **Reasoning:** The goal for this change is to make the Concealed Carry's overheal less powerful. A non-drainable and permanent overheal unless you take damage is a little too much.

#### Mad Milk
**Type:** Secondary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** Players heal 50% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk, Can be used to extinguish fires, Extinguishing teammates reduces cooldown by -50%
- **Negative Stats:** This weapon deploys 15% slower
- **Changes:** Increased damage healing from 35% to 50%, Increased effect duration from 6s to 10s, Removed 'Debuff duration is based on splash distance' stat, Effect duration is dependent on distance. The effect is shortened on close range, but longer on far range, Increased cooldown from 20s to 30s, Increased extinguish cooldown from 10s to 15s
- **Reasoning:** Mad milk is now stronger! But it has a longer cooldown bwomp

#### Witches Brew
**Type:** Secondary | **Status:** Rebalance
- **Positive Stats:** While under the effects, +25% movement speed and damage done and damage taken will be mini-crits
- **Negative Stats:** []
- **Changes:** Mark for Death won't be active unless you damage or attack an enemy while the effect was active, Mark for Death lasts 8s if you want to be a big ol' meanie and damage/attack people
- **Reasoning:** The goal for this change is to make it less easy for the enemy to obliterate you the moment that mark for death is on. (Update, they made it so that the 'Mark for Death' icon isn't visible through walls. This change is kind of pointless now lol.)

#### Bloxaide
**Type:** Secondary | **Status:** Concept
- **Positive Stats:** Drink to regain up to +75 health, +25% faster consumption time, +50% increase in charge recharge rate
- **Negative Stats:** -50% healing from healing sources on wearer
- **Changes:** Health drink concept, Substantial healing boost, Trade-off with other healing sources

- **Negative Stats:** -75% damage penalty

- **Negative Stats:** -20% damage penalty, -20% slower firing speed
- **Changes:** Pistol concept for Trooper, Increased clip size, Accuracy improvements
- **Reasoning:** This has been one of the weapons that I'm really intrigued and interested in seeing. A Trooper pistol that's a sidegrade to your usual hitscan shotgun. It might be an underused/inoffensive concept and probably would have the same popularity as 50-AE where people do use it, it's just that some prefer MAC-10 more. Who knows.
