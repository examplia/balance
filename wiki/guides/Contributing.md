  "type": "Weapon Type",
  "image": "images/your-weapon-image.png",
  "stats": {
    "positive": ["Positive stat 1", "Positive stat 2"],
    "negative": ["Negative stat 1", "Negative stat 2"]
  },
  "changes": ["Change description 1", "Change description 2"],
  "reasoning": "Explanation for the concept and changes",
  "isConcept": true
}
```

### Required Fields

- **class** (string): Class this weapon belongs to
  - Flanker, Trooper, Arsonist, Brute, Mechanic, Doctor, Marksman, Annihilator, Agent
- **type** (string): Weapon slot - "Primary", "Secondary", "Melee", "Building"
- **image** (string): Path to weapon image in `images/` folder
- **stats** (object): Positive and negative stat changes

### Examples

#### New Weapon Concept
```json
{
  "name": "Plasma Blaster",
  "class": "Flanker",
  "type": "Primary",
  "image": "images/plasma-blaster.png",
  "stats": {
    "positive": ["+25% faster firing speed", "On hit: Apply plasma burn"],
    "negative": ["-20% damage penalty", "-15% clip size"]
  },
  "changes": [],
  "reasoning": "A high-tech weapon concept for Flanker focusing on sustained damage.",
  "isConcept": true
}
```

#### Weapon Rebalance
```json
{
  "name": "Existing Weapon",
  "class": "Trooper",
  "type": "Primary",
  "image": "images/existing-weapon.png",
  "stats": {
    "positive": ["+10% damage bonus"],
    "negative": ["-5% slower firing speed"]
  },
  "changes": ["Increased damage bonus from 5% to 10%", "Added firing speed penalty"],
  "reasoning": "Balancing the weapon to reduce its power while maintaining viability.",

}
```

## Guidelines for Stats

### Be Specific
- ‚úÖ "+25% faster firing speed"
- ‚ùå "Faster firing"

### Use Standard Terminology
- Follow TF2 conventions: "mini-crits", "crits", "blast jumping"

### Balance is Key
Ensure positive and negative stats create interesting trade-offs.

### Keep it Concise
Each stat should be a short, clear description.
