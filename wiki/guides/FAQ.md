## Weapon Concepts & Rebalances

### What's the difference between a rebalance and a concept?

## Balance Philosophy

### Why do you make these changes?
Our goals:
- Improve weapon viability across all classes
- Enhance counterplay opportunities

A viable weapon:
- Has clear strengths in specific situations
- Has meaningful weaknesses that can be exploited
- Contributes to team strategies
- Feels rewarding to use skillfully

We identify power creep and suggest nerfs that:
- Reduce overwhelming advantages

- Improve counterplay
- Maintain competitive balance

We're focused on improving existing classes first, but new class concepts are always welcome for discussion.
